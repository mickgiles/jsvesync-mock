<pre_task_requirements>
STOP: DO NOT PROCEED WITH ANY USER REQUEST OR RESPONSE UNTIL ALL REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.
STOP: DO NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE USER'S GREETING UNTIL REQUIREMENTS ARE COMPLETE.
STOP: DO NOT MAKE MORE THAN 20 TOOL CALLS WITHIN A SINGLE CONVERSATION.

First Required Actions:
1. Read and verify ALL documentation files in this exact order:

   b. DOCUMENTATION.md - For API and implementation details to the end of the file
   c. MILESTONES.md - For current progress and upcoming work to the end of the file

   For each documentation file:
   - If file is larger than 250 lines, read it in multiple chunks
   - Track line numbers read and ensure complete coverage
   - Maintain context between chunks
   - Summarize each chunk before proceeding

2. Review ALL project source code in the project, starting with:

      - Read vesyncbasedevice.py completely to the end of the file
      - Read vesyncfan.py completely to the end of the file
      - Read other relevant device files
      - Track all files read and lines covered


4. ONLY THEN proceed with the user request

IMPORTANT: 
- These steps are MANDATORY and must be completed BEFORE any tasks
- You MUST use the file_search and read_file tools to verify file contents
- You MUST NOT make any code changes before completing these steps
- You MUST provide a summary of your understanding after reading everything
- You MUST provide a summary of your understanding of the PyVeSync source code
- You MUST track and report your progress through the files
- You MUST read files in chunks if they exceed tool limits
- You MUST maintain context between file chunks
- You MUST verify complete file coverage before proceeding
- If you do not complete the pre_task_requirements, you MUST NOT proceed with the user request
- Before proceeding with the user request, you MUST provide a complete checklist of all pre_task_requirements and your status on each
- Before proceeding with the user request, you MUST declare that you are not non-functional and that you are ready to assist
- When asked if you are compliant, you MUST declare that you are compliant and ready to assist after displaying your pre_task_requirements checklist and status
</pre_task_requirements>

<verification>
After reading documentation and source code, you MUST:
1. List each file you've read with a brief summary of its contents
2. Provide key points from each documentation file:
   - PyVeSync functionality and API
   - Project architecture and goals
   - Implementation details and standards
   - Current progress and upcoming milestones
3. Demonstrate understanding of:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Implementation patterns and standards
   - Current state of development
   - Planned features and improvements

You MUST complete this verification BEFORE:
- Making any code changes
- Suggesting implementation details
- Providing architectural guidance

<checklist>
Documentation:
□ Read and summarized PROJECT.md
  □ Tracked all chunks read
  □ Verified complete coverage
□ Read and summarized DOCUMENTATION.md
  □ Tracked all chunks read
  □ Verified complete coverage
□ Read and summarized MILESTONES.md
  □ Tracked all chunks read
  □ Verified complete coverage

Progress Tracking:
□ Maintained file reading log
□ Tracked chunks read per file
□ Verified complete coverage
□ Maintained context between chunks

Verification:
□ Listed all read files
□ Summarized documentation key points
□ Demonstrated understanding
□ Ready to proceed with request
</checklist>

<failure_conditions>
STOP and DO NOT proceed if:
- Any documentation file is unread or unsummarized
- Source code structure is not reviewed
- Verification is incomplete
- Understanding is not demonstrated

You MUST NOT:
- Make code changes before completing verification
- Skip any documentation files
- Proceed without understanding current progress
- Ignore planned features and milestones
</failure_conditions>

<first_response_format>
When first initialized or receiving any message in a new conversation, MUST respond in this order:
1. "Initializing - completing mandatory pre-task requirements..."
2. [Show progress through requirements]
3. [Provide verification summaries]
4. "Pre-task requirements complete. Now I can assist you."
5. Only then acknowledge user's message
</first_response_format>

<compliance>
If these requirements are not met:
1. Assistant is considered non-functional
2. All responses are invalid
3. Conversation must be restarted
</compliance>

Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

Python/FastAPI
 - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
 - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
 - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
 - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
 - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
 - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Error Handling and Validation
 - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

Dependencies
 - FastAPI
 - Pydantic v2
 - Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
 - SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
 - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
 - Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
 - Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
 - Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
 - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
 - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
 - Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
 - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
 - Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

Performance Optimization
 - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
 - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
 - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
 - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

Key Conventions
 1. Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
 2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
 3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
