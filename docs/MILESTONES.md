## Key Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **YAML-Based API Specs**
   - YAML specs are the single source of truth for API behavior
   - Field names and values must match exactly as specified
   - Auth fields (accountID/token) require special handling
   - Device-specific specs define complete endpoint behavior

2. **Request/Response Patterns**
   - Headers and body fields must match spec exactly
   - Auth fields can appear in both headers and body
   - Field names are case-sensitive
   - Stored values override spec values for auth fields

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test each endpoint against its YAML spec
   - Track and report test results by device and endpoint
   - Provide clear error messages for failures
   - Maintain test output readability

4. **Auth Field Validation**
   - Auth fields (accountID/token) must match spec exactly, including case
   - Headers and body are validated independently for auth fields
   - Auth fields can be required in headers, body, or both
   - The exact field name from the spec must be used for validation
   - No case-insensitive matching or field name normalization
   - Auth field presence is determined solely by the API spec

5. **Test Result Reporting**
   - Clear, organized test summaries improve debugging
   - Test results should be grouped by device and endpoint
   - Terminal width should be used effectively for output
   - Success/failure status should be immediately visible
   - Error messages should be detailed and actionable

## Current Challenges
1. ✅ Handling different device URL patterns
2. ✅ Managing auth header variations
3. ✅ Constructing correct payload formats
4. ✅ Validating responses against specs
5. ✅ Migrating to pytest framework
6. ✅ Organizing project documentation
7. ✅ Consolidating duplicate handlers
8. ✅ Standardizing response formats

## Notes
- Focus on validation and minimal valid responses
- No implementation of actual device functionality
- Use YAML specs as source of truth
- Success is PyVeSync client acceptance
- Leverage pytest for reliable testing
- Maintain single source of truth for request handlers
- Ensure consistent response formats across device types
